# business-card
This repository features a portfolio card template I created for fun.  I used HTML and CSS to build the portfolio card. It showcases the information and social media links of the user in a visually appealing manner. 

Features:
Semantic HTML: The code structure follows semantic HTML, using appropriate tags to represent the different sections of the portfolio card.

Meta tags: The code includes meta tags for character encoding, browser compatibility, and responsive viewport settings.

Positioning and layout: The card and its elements are positioned using CSS properties such as position, width, height, top, left, and transform. The elements are layered using the z-index property to achieve a visually pleasing composition.

CSS layout techniques: The CSS code demonstrates the use of flexbox for creating a responsive and centered layout.

CSS styling: The code showcases various CSS properties and techniques for styling elements, including backgrounds, borders, typography, and transitions.
